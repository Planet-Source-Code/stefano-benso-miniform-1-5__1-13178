This is a free container control I made because I needed an ocx that I couldn't find searching 
the Net.
I would like to know if you like it (VOTE!), and if it's useful for your projects as I hope.
I worked very hard to this project so please, report to me any bug you may encounter,  I will 
correct them. I will add any other feature you ask to me.

Main features:

-Container: you can scroll controls you placed on Miniform in any direction.
-UseAsForm: you can use MiniForm as a form, with title bar 3D and others visual effects!
-Gradient: shade your MiniForm control with tons of  different random or selected colours!
-Use your MiniForm control as a 3D window, or 3D button adding a few lines of code!
-Set an icon for the title bar!
-Connect your control with an Access database (supports DAO, not yet ADO).
-Includes many properties and methods of standard forms!
